# Expo Camera API Error Handling

This repository demonstrates how to effectively handle errors related to the Expo Camera API.  Specifically, it addresses scenarios where the device lacks a camera, the app is missing necessary permissions, or there are configuration issues with the Camera component.

The `bug.js` file showcases the error, while `bugSolution.js` provides a robust solution.

## Problem

The Expo Camera API can throw errors if the camera is unavailable or permissions are not granted.  This can lead to app crashes or unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The solution involves using asynchronous operations and error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage these situations and provide informative feedback to the user.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. Run the app using Expo Go or your preferred Expo CLI method.

Test the application on devices with and without cameras, and observe how the error handling works.
